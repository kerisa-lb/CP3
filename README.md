* Develop complex applications using files (sequential files)

### Standard 2
Utilize recursive algorithms
* Analyze and solve recursive functions
* Utilize recursive algorithms to solve a problem
* Identify the base case, recursive case, and action of recursive functions

### Standard 3
Create advanced functions
* Create and use overloaded constructors and functions
  * [Tutorial](https://www.kite.com/python/answers/how-to-overload-a-constructor-in-python)

## Strand 2
Students will use searching and sorting algorithms

### Standard 1

## Strand 4
Students will properly employ dynamic data structures / abstract data types (ADTs)

### Standard 1
Demonstrate the ability to use stacks in programs
* Declare stack structures
* Initialize stacks
* Check for empty and full stacks
* Push on to and pop off values from stacks
* Develop an application that uses stacks

### Standard 2
Demonstrate the ability to use queues in programs
* Declare queue structures
* Check for empty and full queues
* Initialize queues
* Enqueue values on to and dequeue values off queues
* Develop an application that utilizes queues

## Strand 5
Students will design and implement advanced object-oriented concepts

### Standard 1
Implement object-oriented programs
* Create classes with minimal extraneous relationships (high cohesion and low coupling)
* Demonstrate and use composition and aggregation (HAS-A) relationships
* Demonstrate the use of class variables (static variables)

### Standard 2
Implement inheritance in an object-oriented program
* Utilize class hierarchies (parent-child relationships)
* Demonstrate IS-A relationships
* Override methods and understand how to call the overriding method from the child
* Demonstrate the protected modifier
* Call a parent class constructor from the child's constructor

### Standard 3
Create and use abstract classes
* Create and implement abstract classes
* Implement interfaces (purely abstract classes)
* Know difference between abstract & interface classes

### Standard 4
Implement polymorphism
* Demonstrate that a parent object variable can hold an instance of a child class
* Determine IS-A relationships via code
* Demonstrate typecasting via method calls of inherited objects

## Strand 6
Students will use Unified Modeling Language (UML) to design object-oriented programs

### Standard 1
Demonstrate the use of UML in design
* Create an activity diagram
* Create a class diagram for the class hierarchy of a program
* Create a sequence diagram for a function
* Translate diagrams to code

## Strand 7
Students will develop a program of significant complexity as part of a portfolio

### Standard 1
Create an individual program of significant complexity (300-500 lines)
* Create design documentation for the project
* Follow accepted object-oriented programming methodology when writing the code

### Standard 2
Compile a portfolio of the individual and group programs developed
* Include sample design work
* Include sample program source code
