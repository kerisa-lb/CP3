# Advanced Computer Programming
Projects that align with the Utah standards for Advanced Computer Programming

## Strand 1
Students will develop applications which made advanced use of the skills and concepts developed in Computer Programming 1 and 2.

### Standard 1
Demonstrate the ability to develop complex applications
* Develop complex applications using input, calculations, and output
* Develop complex applications using control structures (loops, if/else, etc.)
* Develop complex applications using object-oriented programming
* Develop complex applications using data structures
* Develop complex applications using files (sequential files)

### Standard 2
Utilize recursive algorithms
* Analyze and solve recursive functions
* Utilize recursive algorithms to solve a problem
* Identify the base case, recursive case, and action of recursive functions

### Standard 3
Create advanced functions
* Create and use overloaded constructors and functions 
  * [Tutorial](https://www.kite.com/python/answers/how-to-overload-a-constructor-in-python)
  
### Performance Skills
* Develop advanced applications using input, calculations, output, IF structures, iteration, sub-programs, arrays, sorting, and a database
* Demonstrate the ability to use random access files in a program

## Strand 2
Students will use searching and sorting algorithms

### Standard 1
Demonstrate the ability to search data structures in programs
* Develop a binary search
* Compare the efficiency and appropriateness of sequential and binary searches

### Standard 2
Demonstrate the ability to sort data structures in programs
* Sort arrays using iterative sorting algorithms
  * Selection sort
  * Insertion sort
  * Bubble sort
 * Recognize recurseive sorting algorithms
  * Merge sort
  * Quick sort
  * Heap sort
* Compare the efficiency of sorting algorithms

### Performance Skills
* Demonstrate the ability to search data structures using binary and hash searches comparint the efficiency between sequential and binary searches
* Demonstrate the ability to sort data structures using quadratic (n2) and binary (n log n) sorts comparing the efficiency between various sorts using BigO notation

## Strand 3
Students will utilize multidimensional arrays

### Standard 1
Utilize multidimensional arrays
* Initialize multidimensional arrays
* Input and output data into and from multidimensional arrays
* Perform operations on multidimensional arrays
