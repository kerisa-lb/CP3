# Auto Dice Roller
Write a program that you can use to automate D&D dice rolls

## Instructions
Dungeons and Dragons is a popular role-playing game that uses different dice rolls to determine the outcome of certain events. Most D&D players need a set of seven dice to play the game. Your assignment is to write a Python program that automates this dice rolling process.

Write a Python program that:
* Has a working text-based menu to allow the user to select which dice to roll
* Has a unique function for each die (D4, D6, D8, D10, D00, D12, D20)
* Randomly outputs a number 

## Hints
Here are the rules used by Pig Latin:
* If a word begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), add "yay" to the end
  * For example, "exit" is translated to "exityay"
* If a word begins with a consonant, remove all letters before the first vowel and add them to the end of the word, followed by "ay"
  * For example, "yeet" is translated to "eetyay"
